# FCC-certification-project3

Technical Documentation Page

- This is the 3rd certification project for FCC.
- It consists of a nav bar that changes position to a sidebar when the screen width gets smaller.
- Will be a good practice to use the @media query.

### Adding syntax edits to <code> for easier readability

- Used <br> for each code break required for easier readability on the web page. 
- There has to be a better way to apply this. 
- Will need further styling using CSS later to add indentation where required.
