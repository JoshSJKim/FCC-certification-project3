Technical Documentation Page

- This is the 3rd certification project for FCC.
- It consists of a nav bar that changes position to a sidebar when the screen width gets smaller.
- Will be a good practice to use the @media query.

## Adding syntax edits to code tag for easier readability

- Used br tag for each code break required for easier readability on the web page.
- There has to be a better way to apply this.
- Will need further styling using CSS later to add indentation where required.

- Issue resolved. Use pre tags instead of code tags for longer code examples to retain its form.
